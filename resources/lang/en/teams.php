I created Kanka in October 2017 because there was no tool that easily allowed me to create a world with my friends and still allow me to control who could see or do what.

In early 2020 I took a leap of faith to work full time on Kanka thanks to the support of friends and the community.

Jay and I have been friends for almost a decade, and it has been exciting to see him develop Kanka over the past couple years.

In early 2020, I joined Jay to handle both business development & marketing, and I havenâ€™t looked back since!
